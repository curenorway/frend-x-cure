# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with the Storyblok to Webflow migration tool in 5 minutes.

## ‚úÖ What We've Built

This migration tool is **ready to use** with:

- ‚úÖ **Discovery Tool** - Analyzes your Storyblok space
- ‚úÖ **Transformation Pipeline** - Converts Storyblok ‚Üí Webflow format
- ‚úÖ **Team Members Transformer** - Proof of concept (working!)
- ‚úÖ **Rich Text Converter** - Handles Storyblok rich text ‚Üí HTML
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation** - Architecture, design, context

## üöÄ Run in 3 Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd frend-x-cure
npm install
```

### 2. Test the Transformation

```bash
npm run test-transform team-members
```

**Result:** Transforms all 87 team members and saves to `output/transformed/team-members.json`

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Successful: 87
‚ùå Failed: 0
üìä Total: 87
```

### 3. Check the Output

```bash
# View the transformed data
cat output/transformed/team-members.json | head -n 50

# Or open in your editor
open output/transformed/team-members.json
```

## üìä Available Commands

```bash
# Analyze Storyblok space (already run, see reports/)
npm run discover

# Test transformation for team members
npm run test-transform team-members

# Test other content types (coming soon)
npm run test-transform articles
npm run test-transform videos
npm run test-transform projects
```

## üìÅ Important Files

### Documentation (Read These!)

- **README.md** - Main project documentation
- **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** - Complete session history & context
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical architecture
- **WEBFLOW_CMS_DESIGN.md** - Webflow collections design

### Reports (Discovery Results)

- `reports/storyblok-discovery.json` - Full analysis
- `reports/raw-stories.json` - All 909 stories
- `reports/raw-components.json` - All 101 components
- `reports/raw-assets.json` - All 2,957 assets

### Output (Transformation Results)

- `output/transformed/team-members.json` - Transformed team members

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Review the transformed data**
   ```bash
   open output/transformed/team-members.json
   ```
   - Verify field mappings look correct
   - Check slugs are valid
   - Note any issues

2. **Get Webflow credentials**
   - Need: Webflow API token
   - Need: Webflow site ID
   - Add to `.env` file

3. **Manually create Webflow collections**
   - Follow designs in `WEBFLOW_CMS_DESIGN.md`
   - Start with Team Members collection
   - Match field names exactly

### Short-term (Next Session)

4. **Build Webflow uploader**
   - Create `src/clients/webflow.js`
   - Test uploading 5 team members
   - Verify in Webflow Designer

5. **Build more transformers**
   - Articles (medium complexity)
   - Videos (high volume)
   - Projects (most complex)

6. **Handle full content**
   - Current discovery only fetched metadata
   - Need to fetch full story content
   - This will get role, email, images, etc.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module"

Make sure you're in the project directory and have run `npm install`:
```bash
cd frend-x-cure
npm install
```

### "No such file: reports/raw-stories.json"

Run discovery first:
```bash
npm run discover
```

### Transformation shows empty fields

The current `raw-stories.json` only has story metadata, not full content. We need to:
1. Update discovery to fetch full content
2. Or fetch individual stories in transformer

This is expected for now and will be fixed in next iteration.

## üí° Understanding the Output

### Transformed Team Member Structure

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "slug": "john-doe",
  "role": "Developer",
  "email": "john@frend.no",
  "phone": "+47 123 45 678",
  "profileImage": "https://a.storyblok.com/.../photo.jpg",
  "altImage": "https://a.storyblok.com/.../fun-photo.jpg",
  "bio": "",
  "featured": false,
  "sortOrder": 0,
  "tags": [
    { "name": "Digital Workplace", "slug": "digital-workplace" },
    { "name": "Microsoft 365", "slug": "microsoft-365" }
  ],
  "seoTitle": "John Doe - Frend",
  "seoDescription": "...",
  "seoImage": "...",
  "_sourceId": 12345,
  "_sourceUuid": "abc-123",
  "_publishedAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### What Gets Transformed

- ‚úÖ Name, slug (auto-generated from Norwegian characters)
- ‚úÖ Contact info (role, email, phone)
- ‚úÖ Images (profile + alt image)
- ‚úÖ Tags (from Storyblok tag_list)
- ‚úÖ SEO fields (from metaFields or fallbacks)
- ‚úÖ Source tracking (for debugging)
