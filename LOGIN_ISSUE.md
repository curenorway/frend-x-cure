# Login Issue - Debugging Session

## Current Problem
Login form receives a successful response (200) but the page refreshes instead of redirecting to the main application.

## Environment Details
- **Railway Production URL**: Your deployment
- **Local Port**: 3456 (changed from 3000)
- **Authentication Configured in Railway**:
  - `AUTH_USERNAME`: M!gr4ti0n
  - `AUTH_PASSWORD`: U4YAbmnNR-cy9j7aB7WY8.oZZu.t9W6K
  - `SESSION_SECRET`: cure-frend-migration-secret-key-2024

## What We Know Works
1. ✅ JavaScript is executing (console logs appear)
2. ✅ Form submission is being intercepted (`formIntercepted: true` in localStorage)
3. ✅ API request is being made
4. ✅ Server responds with 200 status (successful authentication)
5. ✅ Response is received by the client

## What's Not Working
- ❌ After successful login, instead of redirecting to `/`, the page just refreshes
- ❌ The redirect code `window.location.href = '/'` doesn't seem to execute or work

## Debugging Evidence from localStorage
```javascript
lastLoginAttempt: {
  time: "2025-10-17T23:38:18.434Z",
  username: "M!gr4ti0n",
  stage: "before-fetch"
}
formIntercepted: "true"
lastLoginResponse: "200"
```

## What We've Tried
1. **Fixed JavaScript indentation issues** - The form handler wasn't running due to syntax errors
2. **Added multiple preventDefault methods**:
   - `e.preventDefault()`
   - `e.stopPropagation()`
   - `e.stopImmediatePropagation()`
   - Inline `onsubmit="return false;"`
3. **Changed from async/await to .then().catch()** - To avoid potential async issues
4. **Added localStorage debugging** - To track execution flow
5. **Attached event listener immediately** - Without waiting for DOMContentLoaded
6. **Changed approach entirely** - From form submission to button click:
   - Changed button from `type="submit"` to `type="button"`
   - Added `onclick="handleLogin(event)"` directly
   - Bypassed form submission completely

## Possible Remaining Issues
1. **CSP (Content Security Policy)** - Railway might have headers preventing redirects
2. **Session cookie issues** - Cookie might not be set properly in production
3. **CORS or same-origin issues** - Though unlikely since API calls work
4. **Railway proxy/routing** - Something specific to Railway's infrastructure
5. **Missing response data** - Server might not be sending `{success: true}`

## Next Steps to Try
1. Check Railway logs for any server-side errors
2. Test with absolute URL redirects (e.g., `window.location.href = 'https://your-railway-url.com/'`)
3. Check response headers in browser DevTools Network tab
4. Verify the server is actually returning `{success: true}` in the JSON response
5. Test with a simple test page that just does a redirect to verify redirects work at all
6. Check if there are any Railway-specific environment variables or settings affecting redirects
7. Try using `window.location.replace()` or `document.location.assign()`
8. Add a delay before redirect to see if timing is an issue
9. Check if the main app route (`/`) requires authentication and is redirecting back to login

## Current Code State

### Login Form (ui/login.html)
- Button is `type="button"` with `onclick="handleLogin(event)"`
- Form cannot submit normally
- Multiple layers of submission prevention

### Server (src/ui-server.js)
- Authentication endpoint at `/api/login`
- Returns `{success: true}` on successful login
- Sets session cookie

### Environment (.env)
- Local credentials updated to match Railway
- Session secret configured

## Files Modified
- `ui/login.html` - Multiple attempts to fix form submission and redirect
- `src/ui-server.js` - Removed debug logging
- `.env` - Updated credentials to match Railway
